# Ferry-Tour-Simulation-Operating-Systems-Project
This project simulates a multithreaded ferry transportation system using POSIX threads (pthreads) in C. Vehicles must cross a city via a ferry that operates between two sides, adhering to real-world constraints such as tolls, ferry capacity, and synchronization between concurrent threads.
